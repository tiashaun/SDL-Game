[About]
Just a really really really basic C++ engine framework.
Still a whole lot more that needs to be written.

So far all it does is blit an image to the screen.
Yep.
Thats it.

[Dependancies]

Depends on SDL and SDL_image.
Future builds will probably need SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer and SDL_gfx at the least.
Possibly even Cairo.

[TODO]
Impliment a generic Json Parser and make a few functions around that for loading resource and map files and info.
